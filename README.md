# BestGasPrice
A simple app that figures out the best gas prices based on the location entered and the filters applied.

The setup is quite simple where the user must create a google account and gain access to their API. Generate the code and paste it in a .env file labelled GOOGLE_API_KEY.

Now all the user needs to do it change the city where they would like to see the gas prices of, the origin address and even the weights on what they value the most adding up to 1.

And that is it! The program will generate and rank the best gas stations near the origin based on the weights so the user can have a easily select where to go to get gas.
